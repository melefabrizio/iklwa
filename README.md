# Iklwa 
Iklwa (/îːkxwá/) is a React web app made to allow podcasters to deploy their custom app, with an audio player,
directly from the RSS feed, with little or no developer skills required. 

Also, *iklwa* is the zulu name of the *[assegai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assegai)*, a pole weapon. 
The name comes from the sound that was heard when withdrawn from the enemy's body.  

**Very early stages of development, expect little or no features**

## (Wanted) features
- Audio player
- About page populated from podcast title, description, author, email, etc.
- Fetch podcast info and episodes from RSS feed.
- Search and filter episodes by date, description, title, tags, etc.
- Announcement section from a custom tag in the podcast description

## Build and run

This is a standard `create-react-app` project, so clone the repo, run `npm install` to install all the dependencies, then `npm run start` to set up a
development server or `npm run build` to build for production.
